## Log

### R1D1

Started Android mobile programming practical studies. Learned how to configure basic interfaces and how to use onClick events on buttons.

### R1D2

I kept studying Android mobile programming. Today I learned how layout constraints works, how to insert images in the apps and kept using click events.

### R1D3

Kept studying Android mobile programming. Today I started a project inspired in the Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock game to test the knowledge learned earlier. Thought I had dominated layout constraints but there're always more things to learn.

### R1D4

Today I focused on the theme customization and tried to give a different look to the created apps.

### R1D5

Improved the logic of the app inspired in the rock-paper-scissors. Still focused in the interface and in the understanding of new themes. Learned how the unit of measurement dp works #alwaysUse

### R1D6

I created a new app's structure to apply acquired knowledge about layout. The goal this time is to configure an interface inspired in a news' app able to be well seen in all screen sizes and dpi.
Improved the knowledge in layout by studying dpi and constraints concepts.

### R1D7

Just finished news' layout app. I learned a lot about component positioning using Constraint Layout and how to put a ScrollView to enhance the view.

### R1D8

Creation of an app's layout inspired on Netflix. I learned how to use guidelines to help layout's creation.

### R1D9

Studied about the other existent layout types. Learned how Relative, Linear, Frame and Coordinator layout works.

### R1D10

Started an app to calculate the best fuel supply option taking into account alcohol and gasoline's price using linear layout in the interface. Linear layout is a little easier to use than constraint, mainly in forms.

### R1D11

Finished "Álcool ou gasolina" app.

### R1D12

Learned how some basic interface components work (ToggleButton, Switch, Toast e AlertDialog).

### R1D13

Learned how some more basic interface components work (ProgressBar and SeekBar).

### R1D14

Developed an app that calculates tips based on the bill and percentage values. Learned how to use SeekBar and EditText's onChange events.

### R1D15

App to exemplify a RecyclerView implementation created. Learned how to use List and Recycler views.
