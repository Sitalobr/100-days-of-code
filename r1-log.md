## Log

### R1D1

Started Android mobile programming practical studies. Learned how to configure basic interfaces and how to use onClick events on buttons.

### R1D2

I kept studying Android mobile programming. Today I learned how layout constraints works, how to insert images in the apps and kept using click events.

### R1D3

Kept studying Android mobile programming. Today I started a project inspired in the Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock game to test the knowledge learned earlier. Thought I had dominated layout constraints but there're always more things to learn.
